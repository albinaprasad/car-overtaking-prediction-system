Your Vehicle (e.g., vehicle3):

Speed:
Change _currentSpeed to simulate different speeds for your vehicle.
Example: Set it to 95 km/h to simulate a high-speed scenario.
Position:
Adjust the latitude and longitude of _currentPosition to simulate your vehicle’s location.
Heading:
Change _currentHeading (in degrees) to simulate the direction your vehicle is facing.
Example: A heading of 0° means facing North.
Other Vehicles (e.g., vehicle4, vehicle2, etc.):

Speed:
Modify the speed value in the simulated data for each other vehicle.
For triggering overtaking:
Set an other vehicle’s speed low enough so that your vehicle’s speed is at least 10 km/h higher.
Example: Other vehicle at 75 km/h when your vehicle is at 95 km/h.
For a non-trigger scenario:
Increase the other vehicle’s speed closer to yours.
Position:
Adjust the latitude and longitude so that the other vehicle is:
Within 50 meters of your vehicle.
Positioned such that the bearing from your vehicle to it is close to your heading (within 30°).
Example: If your vehicle is at (9.6059295, 76.4819432), you might set the other vehicle directly ahead with a slight increase in latitude (e.g., 9.6059395) and the same longitude.
Heading:
Set the other vehicle's heading so that it aligns with your vehicle’s direction.
Example: A heading of 0° if you are both facing North.
Timestamp:
Ensure that the timestamp for each vehicle is current (i.e., within the last 5 minutes) so that the data isn’t filtered out as stale.

Example Adjustments for Triggering the Alert
Your Vehicle (vehicle3):

Position: (9.6059295, 76.4819432)
Speed: 95 km/h
Heading: 0° (North)
Other Vehicle (vehicle4):

Position: (9.6059395, 76.4819432)
(This position should yield a bearing near 0° from your vehicle.)
Speed: 75 km/h
Heading: 0°
With these settings, your vehicle’s speed is 95 km/h, which is 20 km/h higher than 75 km/h. Since 95 > 75 + 10 (i.e., 95 > 85), the overtaking condition should be met, provided the distance (calculated to be within 50 m) and bearing conditions (angle difference ≤ 30°) are also satisfied.

Example Adjustments for a Non-Trigger Scenario
Your Vehicle (vehicle3):
Speed: 75 km/h
Other Vehicle (vehicle4):
Speed: 70 km/h
(Now the condition becomes 75 > 70 + 10, or 75 > 80, which is false.)
Or you could adjust the positions so that the distance is more than 50 meters or the bearing difference is over 30°.

By modifying these values in the _simulateTestData() method, you can test various overtaking scenarios. Once you’re done testing, set _testMode to false so that the app uses live data instead of these hardcoded values.
